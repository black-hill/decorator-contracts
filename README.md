# Introduction

[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/thenewobjective/decorator-contracts/_apis/build/status/Build?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/thenewobjective/decorator-contracts/_build/latest?definitionId=11&branchName=master)

TODO:

## Library Installation

TODO:

## Usage

After installation the library can be imported as such:

```typescript
import Contracts from '@thenewobjective/decorator-contracts';
```

It is not enough to import the library though, there are two modes of usage:
`debug` and `production`. This is represented as a boolean argument to the
`Contracts` constructor.

debug mode: `true`

production mode: `false`

```typescript
let {invariant} = new Contracts(true);
```

During development and testing you will want to use debug mode. This will
enable all assertion checks. In production mode all assertion checks become
no-ops for run-time efficiency. As the number of contract definitions can
be numerous, using the appropriate mode becomes increasingly important.

You are not prevented from mixing modes in the event you desire you maintain
a number of checks in a production library.

### Invariants

The `@invariant` decorator describes and enforces the semantics of a class
via a provided assertion. This assertion is checked after the associated class
is constructed, before and after every method execution, and before and after
every property usage (get/set). If any of these evaluate to false during class
usage, an `AssertionError` will be thrown. Truthy assertions do not throw an
error. An example of this is given below using a Stack:

```typescript
@invariant((self: Stack<any>) => self.size >= 0 && self.size <= self.limit)
@invariant((self: Stack<any>) => self.isEmpty() == (self.size == 0))
@invariant((self: Stack<any>) => self.isFull() == (self.size == self.limit))
class Stack<T> {
    protected _implementation: Array<T> = []

    constructor(readonly limit: number) {}

    isEmpty(): boolean {
        return this._implementation.length == 0
    }

    isFull(): boolean {
        return this._implementation.length == this.limit
    }

    pop(): T {
        return this._implementation.pop()!
    }

    push(item: T): void {
        this._implementation.push(item)
    }

    get size(): number {
        return this._implementation.length
    }

    top(): T {
        return this._implementation[this._implementation.length - 1];
    }
}
```

Custom messaging can be associated with each `@invariant` as well:

```typescript
@invariant((self: Stack<any>) => self.size >= 0 && self.size <= self.limit, "The size of a stack must be between 0 and its limit")
@invariant((self: Stack<any>) => self.isEmpty() == (self.size == 0), "An empty stack must have a size of 0")
@invariant((self: Stack<any>) => self.isFull() == (self.size == self.limit), "A full stack must have a size that equals its limit")
class Stack<T> {
    //...
}
```
